# Tims Beacon Service
**Tims Beacon-Service keeps track of all your computers (uptime, cpu-temperature, IPs, last time seen, uptime of system, etc.).**

It is especially helpful for **Raspberry PIs** when you don't have a screen attached.
* easy to install
* Simple overview over all monitored systems
* ready for self-hosting, SQL-DB required

By the way: Don't mix up **Beacons** with delicious **Bacon** ! :)

![Example Installation](projectPreviewImage.png "Example Installation")

Server Requirements
------------
* WebServer with PHP 5.6 or higher
* MySQL Database

Installation on Server
------------
1. Copy all files from **/serverFiles** to your server directory. Make sure you copied .htaccess & .htpasswd as well to ensure nobody except you can view their vulnurable information.
2. Enter your MySQL DB Credentials into **db_connection.php**.
3. Use the */serverFiles/createTable.sql* on your DB to create initale Table-Structure
4. Open https://YOURSERVER/lastKnownIp.php to view the data send by the clients.


Installation on Client
------------
1. Just copy the **/clientFiles/sendBeacon.sh** to your Clients home folder
2. Change the **deviceName** Variable & the serveradress in the sendBeacon.sh
3. Make sure *sendBeacon.sh* is executable: **chmod +x sendBeacon.sh**
4. Add the following line to your crontab (type **crontab -e** in your console) this will call the script every minute:

`0 * * * * bash sendBeacon.sh`

Additional Functions
-------------
* You can send payloads (any String) with the beacons

**_Note:_** In case you don't have _curl_ on your device (for example on some minimal _OpenWRT Routers_) you can replace it in the Bash-File with **http PUT** instead. The package needed to be install in openWrt is called **httpie**.

`http PUT https://YOURSERVER/hey_v2.php whois=DEVICENAME`
